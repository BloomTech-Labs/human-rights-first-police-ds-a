A group of people are protesting outside Waterbury police headquarters around 5:30PM. Police are lined up blocking the roadway; they warn protesters to clear the roadway. Police declare the assembly unlawful, apparently in response to the protesters standing in the roadway. Police again warn protesters to clear the roadway, and say that anyone in the roadway will be arrested. A woman steps out into the street, walking slowly across holding a sign. Police tell her to get out of the roadway; she continues across to the other side. Police move forward and arrest numerous protesters, several of whom do not appear to have been in the roadway to begin with. Several protesters are forced to the ground, including one who is slammed against a police car (see second link). Later in the same incident (around 6:30 in the first link), police aggressively and without apparent reason arrest another protester. An LRAD is mentioned, but apparently not deployed. Waterbury authorities say no property was damaged during the protest. Arrested protesters were not charged. (Note: this is a different incident from ct-waterbury-2 -- see street view.)/2

"Police arrested protesters en masse in downtown Los Angeles. Protesters hands were zip tied excessively tightly behind their backs and they were loaded onto buses and driven around the city. Some were taken to a temporary field jail at UCLA’s Jackie Robinson stadium; UCLA claims it ""failed to stop"" LAPD from using the stadium as a ""staging area,"" but was not told about the field jail until after the fact. Arestees were detained for long periods, still in excessively tight zip ties. Social distancing procedures were not observed. Many protesters allege that conditions in the makeshift jails were poor -- detainees denied medical attention and permission to use the restroom, for instance -- and that they were released, many with dead phones, in unfamiliar places in the middle of the night with no way to get home. Two arrestees allege that police prevented them from leaving before the curfew went into effect, then arrested them for violating the curfew. One arrestee alleges that she was twice threatened with guns, that she was sexually assaulted by police, and that police mocked detainees having panic attacks. Police also allegedly arrested at least one homeless person (to whom the curfew was not supposed to apply) for a curfew violation. A lawsuit has been filed in connection with these and other abuses by the National Lawyers’ Guild; a separate lawsuit has been filed by one of the arrestees.
