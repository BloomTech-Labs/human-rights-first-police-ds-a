""" FUTURE update: add randomized functionality to choose between path-based
script selection based on traning from the 'script_training' and 
path-generating options. Possibly set this up to occur automatically whence
results from a traing session of path-based data becomes available.

Also consider setting up testing to occur automatically whence
sufficient training data becomes available. Also consider scheduling automatic
training per a given number of data points received thereafter. Reccomend having
said training take place on another optional instance (with the bot sentiment
analysis) as memory on current instance is running low.
