FAST API Testing

see tutorial -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7wh5iCydDI&t=250s

Write easy tests using fastapi TestClient. 

Import TestClient 

Create a TestClient passing to it your FastAPI

Create functions with a name that starts with test_ (this is standard pytest conventions).

Use the TestClient object the same way as you do with requests.

Write simple assert statements with the standard Python expressions that you need to check (again, standard pytest).

To run youll need to install pytest. 

Then in the CLI run """
$ pytest
"""

Basic Example

from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
async def read_main():
    return {"msg": "Hello World"}


client = TestClient(app)


def test_read_main():
    response = client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"msg": "Hello World"}
