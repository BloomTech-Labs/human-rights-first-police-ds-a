5619,5624,"LeRoy Robinson was killed when he crashed after a police chase. Just before 5 a.m. police said they tried to stop Robinson for driving without headlights. According to police, the chase was called off when Robinson turned the wrong way onto one-way Madison Street. Police said they believed the car became airborne about 30 seconds later when it crossed railroad tracks and hit a tree. Robinson‚Äôs family members said that several residents near the crash site told them the chase had continued on Madison, and that the youth was pursued by squad cars without their lights or sirens on over the railroad tracks. His family thought Robinson was rear-ended during the chase, because the car had white paint on the rear bumper, as well as a cracked rear fender after the crash.",1
